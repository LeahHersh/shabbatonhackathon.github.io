# Resources

1. Learn more about [Yavneh on Campus](https://www.yavnehoncampus.org).  

2. Get a head start on the hackathon by familiarizing yourself with the [Sefaria API](https://developers.sefaria.org/reference/).

3. Come to the Advising and Networking tables prepared with questions for professors and industry experts. This is a great opportunity to practice your [30-second elevator pitch](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/business-writing/elevator-pitch/) in a low-pressure environment.   

4. Check out these [hackathon tips](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/blogs/tips-and-tricks-to-crack-a-hackathon/), but feel free to disregard the suggestion that your team must include a frontend and backend developer; this won't necessarily be required in this hackathon.
