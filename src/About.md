# About  

The Shabbaton Hackathon will be a Shabbaton experience followed by a 20-hour hackathon on the weekend of November 6th, hosted at Johns Hopkins University.   

We have secured a *heter* for hackathon participants who are inclined to to network over Shabbat, but otherwise invite students to a full Shabbat at the Johns Hopkins Hillel, where meals, services, and learning opportunities will be provided. Participants will be hosted overnight by ?Shomerei Shabbat? Johns Hopkins students, and the Smokler Center of Jewish Life will be available throughout the hackathon.

During the Hackathon on Sunday, there will be a 2-hour session when participants will have the chance to speak with Hopkins professors and Computer Science professionals. By 4:30 PM, all submissions will be collected, and the event will conclude at 6:30 PM.

### We're looking forward to seeing you there!
